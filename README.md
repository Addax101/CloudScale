# CloudScale
A system for automating the scaling and management of cloud resources.
It allows you to provision and configure cloud resources, monitor their performance, and automatically adjust the number and types of resources based on workload demand.

## Features
* Provision and configure cloud resources using a configuration management tool such as Ansible, chef, or puppet
* Monitor resource performance and receive alerts when thresholds are breached
* Autoscale resources based on workload demand
* Optimize resource usage to reduce costs
## Requirements
* A cloud account with a supported provider (e.g. AWS, Azure, GCP)
* A configuration management tool (e.g. ansible, chef, puppet)
## Installation
* Clone the CloudScale repository: `https://github.com/Addax101/CloudScale.git`
* Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
* Configure your cloud account and desired resources in the configuration files
